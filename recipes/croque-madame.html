    <h1>Croque Madame</h1>

    <p>
        A classic croque madame makes the perfect French-inspired brunch or lunch dish. Once you try this, it will be hard to have "just" a ham and cheese sandwich again. Don't cheat and use Swiss cheese, this deserves the real thing! Using Gruyère cheese will make all the difference. <span>recipe by C R Henning</span>
